Thanks for purchasing my Floating Embers Pack for Unity 3D!

If you haven’t already, import the package into your Unity 3D project by double clicking the .unitypackage file and then click the 'import' button. Make sure all files are selected, the demo scene can be un-ticked if you don’t need it.

Using the prefabs:

There are three strengths: Slow, medium and fast. The Slow is more of a static “float”, the medium has a slight movement and fast has a lot of horizontal movement.

All prefabs are set to be affected by Wind Zones, but this can easily be turned off by un-ticking “External Forces” in the inspector.

All particle systems are editable. Enjoy!

Thank you!
